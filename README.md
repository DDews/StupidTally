This is a stupid tally program to help quickly create spreadsheets of recurring damage numbers.

When trying to record recurring damage numbers for gathering statistics, run this program as administrator.
This allows the keybindings to be global hotkeys that work within an active game.

The default bindings are:
	ALT+SHIFT+# 
		to start typing a damage number.
	ALT+SHIFT+END
		to finish typing a damage number and tally it.
		if it doesn't exist, it will be added to the data table on the right.
		if it already exists, it will increase its tally.
	ALT+SHIFT+DEL
		to clear the typed damage number and start over.
	CTRL+SHIFT+S
		to export the data table to a CSV file (to be imported or used in spreadsheet programs)


Troubleshooting:
Since this program is unsigned and written by a fk idot,
I suspect you may need to add this program's executable to Windows' list of ignored processes in security and virus protection.
